# Spaceship-Game
This is my first "large" pygame project. I started developing it around March 20th 2020.
## Gameplay
It's a simple shooter in which you play as a spaceship and must escort your fleet from Proxima Centauri back to The Solar System.
You encounter many different enemies along your way, which vary in difficulty as the game progresses. There are also shops inbetween levels, so you can upgrade your ship.
## Test thing
Hello there! General Kenobi. **You** are a bold one.
